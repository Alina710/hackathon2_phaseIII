# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase I - Todo CLI Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on WHAT, not HOW |
| Requirement Completeness | PASS | All requirements are testable |
| Feature Readiness | PASS | Ready for /sp.plan |

## Notes

- Specification complies with Evolution of Todo constitution
- Phase I boundaries clearly defined (no persistence, no auth, no APIs)
- All 5 core features specified with acceptance scenarios
- Python 3.11+ mentioned as dependency (constitution mandate) but no implementation details
